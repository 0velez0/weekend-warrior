# 12 Days of Xmas

Write a program that prints out all of the lyrics to the traditional song _The Twelve Days of Christmas_.

## Specifications
- You don't have to worry about capitalization; the entire text can be case insensitive
- You can sensibly ignore any punctuation: hyphens can be spaces, and commas and periods can be ignored
- There should be a blank line between each verse
- You must ordinalize your numbers: "first day of Christmas", "Four calling birds", etc
- If there's more than one gift in a specific verse, the last line should begin with "and".
- The verse always begins with _On the N day of Christmas my true love game to me_
- The gift for day five is always upper case because everyone remembers that one and sings it real loud.

### The gifts, in case you can't remember
- Twelve drummers drumming
- Eleven pipers piping
- Ten lords-a-leaping
- Nine ladies dancing
- Eight maids-a-milking
- Seven swans-a-swimming
- Six geese-a-laying
- FIVE GOLDEN RINGS
- Four calling birds
- Three french hens
- Two turtle doves
- And a partridge in a pear tree
